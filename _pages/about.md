Hello! I'm a Msc student at the [University of Abomey-Calavi](https://cours.uac.bj/), in the Departement of Biochemistry and Molecular biology. To date, my work has focused on major malaria vectors. In particular, I'm interested in the interplay between the mosquito microbiome and its insecticide resistance phenotype. I keep a general interest in mosquito omics and population genomics, especially how each of those components of mosquito biology are involved in the rapid evolution and spread of resistance in the major malaria vector, *Anopheles gambiae*.

### My master

I am currently studying for my Msc in Applied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in [FAST](https://cours.uac.bj/u/UyhNIEfzgi1Dh_6kKWS-/), UAC and in internship in the *Tropical Infectious Disease Research Center, University of Abomey-Calavi, Cotonou, Benin* under the supervision of Professor [Luc S. Djogbénou](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-luc-salako-djogbenou). My work is is focused on exploring the phageome and its links with insecticide resistance in wild-caught *Anopheles gambiae s.s.* from Northwest Benin exposed to deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl, two insecticides used in vector control by our NMCP. We discover pattern between the abundance of bacteriophages orders in *An. gambiae s.s.* and its insecticide resistance phenotype.

### Others activities during my internship

During my internship, I have worked on resistance's genes, especially the genetics diversity of the *chloroquine resistance transporter* (PfCRT) *Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase* (Pfdhfr) and *dihydropteroate synthase* (Pfdhps) genes in *Plasmodium falciparum*. I also worked on the installation and the test of Oxford Nanopore’s MinION Sequencing Device in our lab. We have then sequenced a *P. falciparum* strain named *bn229* with the Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004) to investigate its resistance genes. I have analyzed RNA-seq data to investigate differential expressed genes using using the protocol described in Specific histone modifications associate with alternative exon selection during mammalian development
